So all you have to do is Undock => Dock for the cheats to apply. Or use ⁠reverse-nx-rt  Mode: Handheld => Mode: Docked which is much easier to do.\n\n2.) You can experience these in Handheld . Just use ⁠reverse-nx-rt and set mode to Mode: Docked.\n\nNotes;\n\n1.) The RRS 1440p and 4K 2160p are experimental for use with Emulator. It may crash the game if you use it on Switch Console.\n"
